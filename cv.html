<h5 class="cv" name="education">Education</h5>
<ol>
<li>2021(june?), <b>PhD in Computer Science [waiting for defense]</b><br>co-joint degree between the University of Porto, Minho and Aveiro<br><small>The PhD thesis was on machine learning -- more specifically computer vision (Rethinking a Deep Learning Pipeline for Images). The major highlights from the thesis:
</small></li>

<ul>
<p class="float-right"><img src="imgs/cv/cv-prates.jpg" width="100"></p><li><b>Background invariant training applied to electrical insulator detection</b><br><small>Deep learning methods are vulnerable to changes in background, even if they do not affect the object of interest. We show that adversarial training (similar to GANs) can be used to greatly ameliorate this problem. The method was applied to electrical insulator detection, in collaboration with a team from Brazil.
</small></li>


<li><b>Improving accuracy under class imbalance conditions using ranking</b><br><small>Sometimes not all groups are well-represented in the data: consider patients with differing disease severity, or fraud and fault detection where the anomaly is rare, or racial under-representation. We have borrowed concepts from the ranking literature to improve on the classification accuracy of these under-represented cases.</small></li>


<li><b>Iterative inference</b><br><small>Deep learning predictions are typically produced in a single-shot during the forward-pass. The proposed method allows for predictions to take place during the backward-pass and be, therefore, iterative. This allows incremental improvements of the decisions, including those generated by third-party machine learning models.</small></li>


</ul>

<li>2015, <b>MSc in Mathematical Engineering [graduated with honors; 18/20]</b><br>University of Porto<br><small>The masters focuses on data: <ol> <li>from machine learning to statistics</li> <li>optimization and mathematical modelling.</li> </ol> My thesis consisted of a critical review on a wide range of families of models (differential equations, stochastic simulations, cellular automata, etc) applied to epidemiology, more specifically HIV-1 immune response. The thesis was funded by a grant from the Mathematics Center of the University of Porto (CMUP).
</small></li>


<li>2012, <b>BSc in Computer Science [graduated with honors; 16/20]</b><br>University of Porto<br><small>Curriculum: <ol> <li>Practical programming foundations: C, Java, design patterns, web development, SQL, etc</li> <li>Theoretical computer science: data structures, automata theory, lambda calculus.</li> </ol>
</small></li>

<ul>
<p class="float-right"><img src="imgs/cv/cv-apoo.png" width="100"></p><li><b>Apoo, a virtual machine</b><br><small>During my bachelors, I helped with the development of Apoo (together with Profs Rogério Reis and Nelma Moreira), a virtual machine that is currently being used to teach Assembly. Apoo is written in Python and GTK+.</small></li>
