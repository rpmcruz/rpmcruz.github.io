<p>Hey! I have graduated in <b>applied mathematics</b> and I am now finishing my PhD, applying <b>machine learning</b> to medical images, at the University of Porto (FEUP), Portugal. I am someone who is passionate about science and an avid reader, I enjoy everything from biology to physics to economics, and the computational methods which help us make sense of the world. <small>&mdash; Ricardo Pereira de Magalhães Cruz</small></p>
