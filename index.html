<p>Hey! I am a couple of months from my <b>PhD in Computer Science</b> and a <b>teacher assistant</b> at the FEUP, University of Porto, Portugal. My research has been on <b>machine learning applied to medical images.</b> I am someone who is passionate about science and an avid reader, I enjoy everything from biology to physics to economics, and the computational methods which help us make sense of the world.</p>
