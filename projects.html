<b>objdetect package</b>
</a>
<br>Light-weight and versatile one-stage object detection framework
<br><span class="description">I developed this one-stage object detection framework because existing frameworks, such as detectron2, are either for two-stage models or are not versatile and simple enough to adapt for new models. At the very least, I hope this package is educational for someone learning object detection.</span>
