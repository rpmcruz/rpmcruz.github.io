<p><b>objdetect package</b></p>
<p>Light-weight and versatile one-stage object detection framework</p>
<p><small>I developed this one-stage object detection framework because existing frameworks, such as detectron2, are either for two-stage models or are not versatile and simple enough to adapt for new models. At the very least, I hope this package is educational for someone learning object detection.</small></p>
