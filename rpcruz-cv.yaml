biography: 'Ricardo Cruz has worked on a wide range of machine learning topics, with particular emphasis on theoretical aspects of deep learning and computer vision -- with 20+ publications and 100+ citations in such topics as: • adapting ranking models for class imbalance; • making convolutional neural networks invariant to background; • making them faster by adjusting the computational effort to each image; • losses for ordinal regression. He is a Post-doc Researcher on autonomous driving at the Faculty of Engineering, University of Porto, and he has been a researcher at INESC TEC since 2015, where his research earned him the computer science PhD in 2021. He has a BSc in computer science and a MSc in applied mathematics. He has frequently been an invited professor at the Faculty of Engineering, University of Porto, where he earned a pedagogic award.'
