      title: Human Feedback during Neural Network Training
      subtitle: When a model makes a wrong prediction, a typical solution is to acquire more data related to the error -- this is an expensive process known as active learning. Our proposal combines active learning with interpretability so the user can correct such mistakes while the model trains. This work resulted in a thesis that I supervised.

      title: Neural Networks Robust to Background Changes
      subtitle: While training an electrical insulator detector, we noticed a large drop in accuracy when going from the controlled studio (training set) to outdoors (testing set). The proposed method uses a background generator to generate adversarial backgrounds and a mask generator to introduce this background to the training image. A paper was published from this work.

      title: Annotation Aid Tool using GrabCut
      subtitle: "Annotations were necessary for a project whose goal was to learn a sequential segmentation model for the movement of mice. For that purpose, I developed a small tool to aid the annotation effort. The tool processes the video frames sequentially in two steps: (1) the annotator first selects the region where the mouse is, and (2) the annotator selects some positive pixels (left-click) and negative pixels (right-click) until he/she is satisfied with the segmentation produced by the GrabCut algorithm."

      title: Classification of Cervical Cancer Risk
      subtitle: Cervical cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women. The goal of the TAMI project was to automate cervical cancer screening via Pap smears. A non-parametric ordinal loss for neuronal networks was proposed to promote ordinal output probabilities (accuracy of 75.6% for seven classes and 81.3% for four classes). A paper was published based on this work.
