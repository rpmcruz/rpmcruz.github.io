Our proposal combines active learning with interpretability so the user can correct such mistakes while the model trains. This work resulted in a thesis that I supervised."
        - text: "**Neural Networks Robust to Background Changes.** While training an electrical insulator detector, we noticed a large drop in accuracy when going from the controlled studio (training set) to outdoors (testing set). The proposed method uses a background generator to generate adversarial backgrounds and a mask generator to introduce this background to the training image. A paper was published from this work."

For that purpose, I developed a small tool to aid the annotation effort. The tool processes the video frames sequentially in two steps: (1) the annotator first selects the region where the mouse is, and (2) the annotator selects some positive pixels (left-click) and negative pixels (right-click) until he/she is satisfied with the segmentation produced by the GrabCut algorithm."

A non-parametric ordinal loss for neuronal networks was proposed to promote ordinal output probabilities (accuracy of 75.6% for seven classes and 81.3% for four classes). A paper was published based on this work."
