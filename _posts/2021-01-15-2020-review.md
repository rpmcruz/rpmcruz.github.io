While 2020 has been a crappy year for most everybody due to the pandemic, it has actually been a pretty good year for me. New house, finished my Ph.D. thesis and earned a couple of fun awards.

My girlfriend and I bought our house debt-free after years of hard-work and painstaking frugality -- the timing could not have been better, I happen to have liquidated my investments just before the economic downturn. After we bought the house, we have invested heavily (since there is nowhere to spend money!) and since the markets were very cheap for a few months, we managed to grow our finances quite a bit. We missed out on some opportunities in tech stocks, gold and digital currency, because we thought the pandemic would be short-lived so we focused our efforts on the hardest hits markets, but still we have been doing pretty well.

In terms of career, I finished my thesis at the end of 2020 and my Ph.D. is now almost past me. I am not sure this was the best ways to spend four/five years of my life. The collaboration with the hospital did not work out, so I ended up coming up with a thesis of sorts. The title is very broad (Rethinking a Deep Learning Pipeline for Images) because I published quite a bit, but on many disparate topics. Looking at the bright side, I learned quite a lot about the internals of how machine learning works, and it has opened doors in many ways.

I am not sure what I will be doing after my Ph.D. grant runs out. On the one hand, I could just chill: I have a fun part-time job as a TA and I also help a family member manage her business. That's more than enough to survive and I can always add a couple more small jobs. On the other hand, I would like to be more financially secure and to have my own business: for that, doing a "real" job might help a lot. I am thinking of going to interviews and see if they spark my interest.

The past year has also been a fun year in terms of awards:

1. I was awarded 50â‚¬ for filling out a questionnaire -- it was about time I finally earned something hehe!
2. In a national conference (RECPAD), I was voted best presentation -- earned a Nvidia Nano Jetson device (which is like a Raspberry Pi) which I have connected to my TV and I have been playing a lot of good-old Mario on that. :)
3. My students (as a TA) ranked me highly in the questionnaires, therefore I was one of the teachers at my faculty (FEUP) that earned a "pedagogic award". I am very humbled and happy by this.
4. In an "sustainable ideas" contest, I also earned a bike for a very simple idea: teach and help people use wake-on-lan.
