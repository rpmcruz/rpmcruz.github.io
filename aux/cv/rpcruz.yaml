summary: "For the last five years, I have been working as a machine learning researcher at INESC TEC. I have just finished my Ph.D. thesis which I will defend very soon. Meanwhile, I have also been working at FEUP as a teacher assistant (TA): teaching Python and C++.

As a machine learning researcher, I have worked mostly on deep learning applied to computer vision, using both TensorFlow and PyTorch. In the past, I have participated in many open-source projects and also did much freelance work: on web development (flask), databases (mongo, postgres), multimedia (sdl, gtk, qt), server administration (hpc) and others.

In terms of education, I am about to finish my Ph.D. in computer science. I have a masters in applied mathematics and a bachelors in computer science."
