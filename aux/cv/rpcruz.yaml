summary: "For the last few years, I have been working at INESC TEC -- an institute that does both academic research and industry development. I have been doing both machine learning and computer vision, working in TensorFlow, PyTorch, and OpenCV.

I have just completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science (june 2021). During the Ph.D., I have been serving a few hours per week as a Teacher Assistant at the Faculty of Engineering, University of Porto, helping teach Python and C++. In 2021, I was awarded the Pedagogy Award based on student feedback."
