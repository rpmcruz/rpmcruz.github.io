summary: I am a post-doc at the THEIA project -- a parternship between the University of Porto and Bosch Portugal in order to advance autonomous driving. My expertise is mainly in artificial intelligence and computer vision, working on TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, and a wide variety of other frameworks and languages. I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science in mid-2021.

          #year_: 2022
          subtitle: Light-weight and versatile one-stage object detection framework
          description: I developed this one-stage object detection framework because existing frameworks, such as detectron2, are either for two-stage models or are not versatile and simple enough to adapt for new models. At the very least, I hope this package is educational for someone learning object detection.
